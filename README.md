# ToDoList
A To Do List application using .NET 5.0 and Angular

## Requirements ##
.NET 5.0

## Notes ##

Angular Material components used for UI.

Angular service for calling the Web API was generated using swagger/NSwagStudio.

Tasks are stored in the .NET user session object.

I wrote some unit tests for the TaskService on the back end but ran out of time.

Tests written using xUnit, with Moq for mocking and Shouldly for assertions.
